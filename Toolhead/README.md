Voron 0.2

I modified the ministealthburner for use with the Orbiter V2.0. In addition I  created a version of this toolhead that allows use of a probe. Because of the different shape, I removed 8mm from the slideswipe probe to make it work with the mini stealthburner toolhead. Use M3-8mm hex bolts. Otherwise follow the assembly instruction from the original repo. Please note that unless you manage the magnets 100% flat and level, your probe will have a preferred seating orientation. You will be receiving the best probe accuracy using the probe in this orientation.

For both tool head and MGN9 carriage there are version with nut insert and heat set inserts, choose which option you prefer. Please note that this carriage is designed to be used with MGN9 rails. For the MGN7 rails, the original carriage should work, but you would need to reposition the hole for the rear mounting hex bolt.

EBB 36 Canbus Mount

I remixed the EBB 36 Can Bus mount, for buttons repositioned at rear, and additional mounting holes to the X-carriage for additional stiffness.
